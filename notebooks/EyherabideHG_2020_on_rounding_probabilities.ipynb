    "## Section 2, clarifying equation defining $k(\\mathbf{y})$\n",
    "\n",
    "Section 2 defines $k(\\mathbf{y}):=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{s(y_i)}=r-\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\lfloor y_i \\rfloor}\\in[0:n-1]$ which makes it unclear what should belong to $[0:n-1]$. It cannot be $\\lfloor y_i \\rfloor$ or $\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\lfloor y_i \\rfloor}$ because both can certainly reach values $\\ge n$ so long as $r\\ge n$, e.g. in the case of $\\mathbf{y}=[r,0,...]$. So it must be for $k(\\mathbf{y})$. To prove this, recall that $0\\le s(y_i) < 1$. Hence, $0\\le k(\\mathbf{y}) \\le n$ and, because $k(\\mathbf{y})$ is a non-negative integer, it follows that $0 \\le k(\\mathbf{y})\\le n-1$. Finally, since $k(\\mathbf{y})\\le r$, it follows that $k(\\mathbf{y})\\in [0:\\mu_{rn}]$, where $\\mu_{rn} = \\min\\{n-1, r\\}$, which is a limit more accurate but may not provide further insight in the context of the original publication as $r \\gg n$."

    "However, the last condition is redundant and can be removed. To provide this, consider first the case in which $t\\ge 1$. Then, the last condition becomes $\\psi(t-1)< 1+\\psi(t)$, which is already guaranteed by the fact that $\\psi(t-1)<\\psi(t)$ as per the first condition. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, consider the case in which $0<t<1$. The last condition can then be written as $ \\psi(1-t)-\\psi(t)< 1 $. However, this is already guaranteed by the first two conditions. Specifically, the second condition ensures that, in the limit for $t \\to 0$, $\\psi(1+t)-\\psi(t)<1$ and, by ensuring that $\\psi(1+t)>\\psi(1-t)$, the first condition ensures that $\\psi(1-t)-\\psi(t)<1$. Since the first condition also ensured that $\\forall x<y\\le0.5, \\psi(x)<\\psi(y)<\\psi(1-y)<\\psi(x)$, then $\\psi(1-t)-\\psi(t)<1$ holds for all values of $0<t\\le0.5$. The argument for values of $0.5\\le t<1$ are analogous. Note that continuity of $\\psi$ is not a requirement in this argument."
