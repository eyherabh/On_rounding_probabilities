    "### Clarifying definition of $k(\\mathbf{y})$\n",
    "\n",
    "In section 2, the unknown predecende of the $\\in$ operator makes the definition of $k(\\mathbf{y})$ not immediately evident. Specifically, the definition is written as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "k(\\mathbf{y}):=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{s(y_i)}=r-\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\lfloor y_i \\rfloor}\\in[0:n-1]\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "thereby raising questions on what should belong to $[0:n-1]$. It cannot be $\\lfloor y_i \\rfloor$ or $\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\lfloor y_i \\rfloor}$. Both can reach values $\\ge n$ when $r\\ge n$, e.g. when $\\mathbf{y}=[r,0,...]$. Hence, it must be $k(\\mathbf{y})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove this, recall that $0\\le s(y_i) < 1$, hence $0\\le k(\\mathbf{y}) < n$. Actually, $k(\\mathbf{y}) < n$ because $k(\\mathbf{y})$ is an integer (in fact, $k(\\mathbf{y})\\in \\mathbb{N}$). Also, $k(\\mathbf{y})\\le r$. Putting this together, it follows that $k(\\mathbf{y})\\in [0:\\mu_{rn}]$ (with $\\mu_{rn} = \\min\\{n-1, r\\}$, as in Bomze et al., 2014).\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, $k(\\mathbf{y})$ can be defined simply as \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "k(\\mathbf{y}):=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{s(y_i)}=r-\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\lfloor y_i \\rfloor}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "which implies that $k(\\mathbf{y})\\in [0:\\mu_{rn}]$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This revised definition may neither be as synthetic as the original nor provide further insight in its original context (in that case, $r \\gg n$, with reduces $[0:\\mu_{rn}]$ to $[0:n-1]$). However, it is still more accurate and, by explicitly resolving the ambiguity mentioned above, some may find it easier to read and interpret.  "

    "\n",
    "Now, consider the case in which $0<t<1$. The last condition can then be written as $ \\psi(1-t)-\\psi(t)< 1 $. However, this is already guaranteed by the first two conditions. Specifically, the second condition ensures that, in the limit for $t \\to 0$, $\\psi(1+t)-\\psi(t)<1$ and, by ensuring that $\\psi(1+t)>\\psi(1-t)$, the first condition ensures that $\\psi(1-t)-\\psi(t)<1$. Since the first condition also ensured that $\\forall x<y\\le0.5, \\psi(x)<\\psi(y)<\\psi(1-y)<\\psi(x)$, then $\\psi(1-t)-\\psi(t)<1$ holds for all values of $0<t\\le0.5$. The argument for values of $0.5\\le t<1$ are analogous. Note that continuity of $\\psi$ is not a requirement in this argument."

    "#### On the implication of $u_i < \\lfloor y_i \\rfloor$\n",
    "\n",
    "The proof states that $u_i < \\lfloor y_i \\rfloor$ implies that $\\exists j\\neq i : u_j\\ge \\lfloor y_j \\rfloor +1 \\ge 1$ and $u_j > y_j$. However, $u_j\\ge \\lfloor y_j \\rfloor +1$ already ensures that $u_j\\ge 1$, Further, since  $u_j \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $\\lfloor y_j \\rfloor \\in \\mathbb{N}$, then $u_j\\ge \\lfloor y_j \\rfloor +1 \\iff u_j > y_j$. Hence, the statement can be reduced to \n",

    "#### Necessity and sufficiency of $u_i < \\lfloor y_i \\rfloor$\n",
    "\n",
    "The condition $u_i < \\lfloor y_i \\rfloor$ is only necessary for $u_j > y_j$ to occur when $\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{N}_r^n$. In that case, $y_i = \\lfloor y_i \\rfloor$. Hence, if $\\forall i, u_i \\ge y_i$ and $\\exists j: u_j > y_j$, then $r = \\mathbf{e}^T\\mathbf{y} < \\mathbf{e}^T\\mathbf{u}$. This result contradicts the fact that $\\mathbf{u} \\in \\mathbb{N}_r^n$, thereby implying that $u_i < \\lfloor y_i \\rfloor$ is necessary for $u_j>y_j$ to occur when $\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{N}_r^n$. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if $\\mathbf{y} \\in r \\Delta^n$ but $\\mathbf{y} \\notin \\mathbb{N}_r^n$, then $\\forall i, y_i > \\lfloor y_i \\rfloor$. Hence, $r = \\mathbf{e}^T\\mathbf{y} > \\mathbf{e}^T\\mathbf{u}$ unless $\\exists j: u_j>y_j$. The condition is necessary but not sufficient. Nevertheless, it holds regardless of whether $\\exists k:u_k < \\lfloor y_k \\rfloor$, thus rendering the latter inesssential. \n",
