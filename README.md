# On rounding probabilities

How to best round probabilities is a common problem that I have encountered in applied bioinformatics, information theory and statistics. In this repository, I aim at exploring the existing literature on this topic, revising and extending it when appropriate. I also aim at researching on the consequences of the machine representation of the probabilities on the best rounding strategy, particularly on differences arising from fixed-point vs floating-point representations. My observations and results can be found in [this series of notebooks](notebooks).
